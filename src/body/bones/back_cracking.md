NEVER USE ANY ARCHES NEAR YOUR SPINE!

# How do I crack my back?
I crack my back by taking my shirt off and using it as a rope behind my spine as a twist back and forth.

I hadn't cracked my back for years, but this method works for me.

The other method I do, but is not as safe, is using towels stacked on top of each other and putting them ontop of my blanket on top of my couch and then I take my shirt off and slide my spine down the towels.
I do NOT recommend this method because it puts pressure on the spine!

I am simply telling you a way that I have used to crack my own back.

# Jeans as a Rope
I recently tried the Jeans behind my spine as a rope while twisting and what good success! A solid crack in a place I surely was wanting to crack for years!
