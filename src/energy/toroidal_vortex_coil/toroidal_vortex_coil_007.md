### Caption: The Coil in this photo shows the forward, forward wrapping, which is much less efficient than the forward, loop backwards, wrapping.

## 22 Cylinder Neodymium Magnets are Inserted In and Out of a Coil of Wire as we measure Voltage.

## When we wrap the coils forward, forward, forward, etc, the voltage was .0055 volts.

## But, when we wrap the coils forward, loop backwards, forwards, loop backwards, etc, the voltage was .0250 volts!

## This represents a 354% increase in efficiency, which is 4.5 times better electrical output!
