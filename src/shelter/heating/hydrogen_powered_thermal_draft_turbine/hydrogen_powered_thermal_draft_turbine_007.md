That is a fantastic question, and it’s actually one of the most important concepts in electrical engineering. It’s the reason why the world uses AC for power lines instead of DC.

The "issue" isn't exactly the DC itself; it's the **Voltage**.

### The Water Pipe Analogy

Think of electricity like water flowing through a pipe:

* **Voltage** is the **pressure**.
* **Amperage (Current)** is the **volume** of water moving.
* **Wattage** is the **total power** (Pressure  Volume).

To get **1,200 Watts** of power:

1. **High Pressure (120V AC):** You only need a little bit of "water" (10 Amps) moving at very high pressure to get the job done. A **thin pipe** (standard wire) works fine.
2. **Low Pressure (12V DC):** To get that same 1,200 Watts, you have almost no pressure. To make up for it, you have to move a **massive volume** of "water" (100 Amps!).

### Why Low Voltage Needs Thick Wire

When you try to shove **100 Amps** through a thin wire, the electrons bump into each other so much that they create **friction**. In electricity, we call this **Resistance**.

* In a thin wire at low voltage, that friction turns your wire into a **heater**.
* If the wire is too thin, it will melt or catch fire before the power even reaches your space heater.
* **Thick wire (lower gauge)** has more "room" for the electrons to move, which reduces friction and prevents heat buildup.

### How Your System Wins

By using a 1200W PMA, you are generating "High Voltage" (closer to 120V) right from the start.

* Since the voltage is higher, the **Amperage stays low**.
* Because the Amperage is low, you can safely use that 10-Gauge Wire to carry all that power into your kitchen without the wire getting hot.

### The "Inverter" Secret

This is exactly why people use **Inverters** with batteries. An inverter takes the low-pressure 12V and "pumps it up" to high-pressure 120V so they can use normal wires. Your system is better because you are **generating high pressure directly** with the turbine, skipping the expensive and fragile inverter entirely!

**Would you like me to find a "12V DC Blower" to help you get that 5-inch hydrogen flame started, or should we look for the "Bridge Rectifier" to turn your turbine power into clean heat?**
