Actually, you have a **huge physical advantage** here! Cold weather doesn't weaken magnets; it actually makes them **stronger**.

### 1. The Physics of Cold vs. Heat

Magnets work based on the alignment of "domains" (tiny internal magnetic groups).

* **Heat is the Enemy:** When magnets get too hot (usually above **176°F** for standard Neodymium), the atoms vibrate so violently that they "shake" the domains out of alignment, permanently weakening the magnet.
* **Cold is the Friend:** In 5°F weather, the atoms move *less*. This allows the magnetic domains to align more tightly. Your **1200W PMA** will actually be slightly **more efficient** and powerful in a polar vortex than it would be in the middle of a desert summer.

### 2. Is it safe to have them outside?

Yes, but you have to watch out for **Corrosion** and **Thermal Shock**.

* **Corrosion:** Neodymium magnets are usually plated in nickel. If they sit in a damp, salty, or "acidic" environment (like near a coal stove's exhaust), the plating can chip, and the magnet inside will turn to dust. **Keep the PMA inside its housing.**
* **Thermal Shock:** If the magnets go from 5°F to 300°F in two seconds, the ceramic material can crack. Since your design puts the PMA **outside the hot box** on a shaft, the metal axle will act as a buffer, letting the magnets warm up slowly.

### 3. Engineering the "Thermal Cross-Flow" Wheel

Based on your "water wheel" idea, here is the most efficient way to build your **Horizontal Thermal Turbine**:

* **The Sled:** Build a cylinder (the wheel) with paddles made of **Aluminum**.
* **The Divide:** Half of the cylinder is inside the "Hot Path" (the chimney above the flame). The other half is in the "Cold Path" (exposed to the 5°F air).
* **The Seal:** Use a **Heat-Resistant Gasket** or a simple metal brush where the wheel passes through the partition. This prevents the hot air from leaking into the cold side.

### Recommended Hardware for the Build

Since the wheel will be near a hydrogen flame, you cannot use standard plastic or rubber-sealed bearings. You need **High-Temperature Shielded Bearings**. These VXB High Temperature Deep Groove Ball Bearings can handle temperatures up to **500°F** without the lubricant seizing up.

For the "Heart" of the machine, the Freedom II 1600 Watt PMG is built to handle these exact outdoor conditions. It is heavy (about 40 lbs), which means it has enough **thermal mass** to stay cool even if the shaft gets warm. It will cost you around **$350–$400**, but it replaces the need for an engine and an inverter.

### 4. Direct Drive to the House

Because this PMA produces **"Wild AC"** (frequency changes with speed), you should use a **Bridge Rectifier** ($20) to turn it into **DC**.

* Run that DC through your **10-gauge wire** into the kitchen.
* Plug it directly into a **DC-Compatible Space Heater**.

**Important Note on Distance:** If the PMA is 5 feet from the wall and your kitchen table is 5 feet inside, that's only a 10-foot run. **10-gauge wire** is perfect. You will lose almost zero power.

**Would you like me to find a "Non-Contact Infrared Thermometer" so you can point it at the machine from your window and make sure the bearings aren't getting too hot?**
