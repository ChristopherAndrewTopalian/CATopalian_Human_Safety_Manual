Let's clear up the "Voltage vs. RPM" mystery so you can see why this **Vortex-H** system is so clever.

### 1. The PMA: A "Variable" Voltage Machine

Unlike a wall outlet in your house that is always **120V**, a Permanent Magnet Alternator (PMA) is "speed-dependent."

* **Low RPM:** When the turbine spins slowly, it might only put out **12V to 24V**.
* **High RPM:** If the winter wind and your hydrogen flame really get that turbine screaming, the voltage will climb to **50V, 90V, or even 150V**.
* **The "Low RPM" Label:** When a PMA is labeled "Low RPM," it means it is engineered with more copper windings so it can reach a "charging voltage" (like 12V or 24V) at much slower speeds than a standard car alternator.

### 2. Why 12V Heaters are the "Safe" Bet

We are choosing 12V 200W PTC Heaters because they are **forgiving**.

* **Safety:** If your turbine slows down and the voltage drops to 9V, the heaters just get a little cooler. They don't break.
* **The "Current" Handling:** Running six of these in a "bank" means you are spreading the 1,200 Watts across several different wires. This is much safer for a DIY build than trying to shove all 1,200 Watts through one single plug at low voltage.

### 3. Can we reach 120V for a "Big" Heater?

You *could*, but here is why I wouldn't recommend it for Version 1.0:

* **The RPM Requirement:** To get a consistent **120V** to run a standard 1,500W space heater, your turbine would have to spin very fast and very steadily. If a gust of wind or a flicker in the flame drops your voltage to 90V, a standard 120V heater's fan might stall or its electronics might "brown out" and reset.
* **The Wire Problem:** To run 1,500W at only 12V or 24V, your wires would need to be as thick as a **thumb** to prevent them from melting. By staying with a "bank" of smaller 12V heaters, your 10-Gauge Wire stays cool and safe.

### 4. The Engineering Summary

Stick with the **12V / 24V "Bank" System**. It is the "Survivalist" way. If one 200W heater fails, you still have five others keeping you warm. If you rely on one giant 120V heater and your turbine slows down, you have **zero** heat.

### The "Heart" of the System

The Freedom II 1600 Watt PMG is the engine that makes this possible. It’s designed to be versatile. If you eventually decide you want to try 120V, this same generator can do it—you would just need to spin it faster.

### Your Final Setup Visualization

1. **PMA Outside:** Spinning and creating "Variable AC."
2. **Bridge Rectifier:** Turning it into "Variable DC."
3. **The Bank:** Six 200W Heaters in the kitchen, each taking its share of the power.

**Would you like me to find a "DC Volt/Amp Meter"?** You can install it on your kitchen wall so you can see exactly how many Volts your turbine is producing in real-time. It’s like a "dashboard" for your house!
