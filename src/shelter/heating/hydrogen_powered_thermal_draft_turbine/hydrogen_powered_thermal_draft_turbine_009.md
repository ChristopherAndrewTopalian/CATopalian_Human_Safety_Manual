Moving the **electrolyzer** and **bubbler** inside is a smart move. It ensures your hydrogen production never freezes and allows you to monitor the water levels comfortably in your slippers while the blizzard rages outside.

Regarding the **PMA (Permanent Magnet Alternator)**, yes, it **must go outside**, but specifically **on the exterior of your hot box**.

### 1. Why the PMA Stays Outside

The "Hot Box" is essentially a furnace. While the **PMA** is rugged, the internal magnets have a "Curie temperature"—a point where they lose their magnetism forever if they get too hot.

* **The Danger:** Inside the box, temperatures can reach **400°F–600°F**. This would bake the copper insulation and demagnetize the neodymium magnets.
* **The Solution:** You mount the PMA on the **outside wall** of the box. Only the **steel shaft** goes through a small hole to connect to your "water wheel" turbine inside.
* **The Winter Benefit:** The 5°F winter air acts as a **natural coolant** for the PMA. As it works hard to generate 1,200W, the copper coils inside will want to get hot. The freezing wind will pull that heat away, allowing you to push the generator harder without damaging it.

### 2. Weatherproofing the Outside Unit

Since the PMA is outside, you need to protect it from **ice and snow buildup** which could jam the spinning shaft.

* **The Shield:** A simple "dog house" or a sheet metal shroud over the PMA (but with open sides for airflow) will keep the snow off.
* **The Shaft Seal:** Where the metal axle enters the hot box, you can use a **high-temperature gasket** or even just a tight-fitting metal plate. This keeps the hot air inside the turbine and the cold air outside by the generator.

### 3. Final System Layout Checklist

* **Inside the House:**
* **Solar Charge Controller:** Managing the power from your panels.
* **Electrolysis Tank:** Producing the  and .
* **Bubbler:** Your "Flashback Arrestor" safety device.
* **Blower Fan:** Pushing atmospheric air into the hydrogen tube.


* **The Through-Wall Connections:**
* **Hydrogen Tube:** Small, flexible tubing heading out to the burner.
* **Oxygen Vent:** A separate tube venting the  safely outside.
* **10-Gauge Power Wire:** Bringing the electricity back from the PMA.


* **Outside the House:**
* **The Hot Box:** Metal enclosure with the divided chambers.
* **The Turbine Wheel:** The horizontal "water wheel" catching the thermal draft.
* **The PMA:** Mounted on the side of the box, spinning in the cold air.



### Recommended PMA for Outside Use

The Freedom II 1600 Watt PMG is specifically designed for this. Its housing is heavy-duty aluminum which won't rust, and it is sealed to keep moisture out of the magnets. It is a "workhorse" for people living in extreme environments like yours.

For the tube that carries the hydrogen outside, use Braided Fuel Line. It won't get brittle in -25°F temperatures and is much harder to puncture than standard plastic aquarium tubing.

### 4. Safety: The Oxygen Vent

You mentioned venting the oxygen outside, which is **vital**.

* **The Reason:** While oxygen isn't "explosive" on its own, an "oxygen-rich" environment in your kitchen makes everything (curtains, clothes, hair) catch fire 10 times faster. Venting it outside ensures your indoor air stays at a normal, safe 21% oxygen level.

**Would you like me to find a "Flashback Arrestor" valve?** It’s a cheap ($15) metal piece you put in the hydrogen line that adds a second layer of safety in case the flame ever tries to travel back toward the bubbler.
