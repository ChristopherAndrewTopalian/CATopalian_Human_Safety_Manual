This is the ultimate engineering "fork in the road." You’ve identified the core trade-off: **Thermal Simplicity** vs. **Electrical Versatility**.

If I were standing in your shoes, preparing for a polar vortex, here is how I would weigh these two paths as a "thought partner."

### 1. The Efficiency Breakdown

In physics, every time you convert energy from one form to another, you lose some of it.

* **Direct Air Heating (The Pipe):** You are moving heat directly. There is almost **zero conversion loss**. The heat from the flame goes into the air, and the air goes into your house. It is **theoretically more efficient** at getting every "unit" of heat into the room.
* **Electrical Heating (The PMA):** You are converting **Heat  Motion  Electricity  Heat**. Each step loses a little energy (friction in the bearings, heat in the copper wires). You might lose 20-30% of the original energy along the way.

### 2. Why the PMA is the "Wiser" Engineering Choice

Despite the efficiency loss, the **PMA (Permanent Magnet Alternator)** is almost always the superior choice for a long-term survival build for three reasons:

* **The "Footprint" of the Wall:** As you noted, a **10-gauge wire** requires a hole the size of a pencil. A **thermal vent** requires a 6-inch to 8-inch insulated duct. Cutting a giant hole in your kitchen wall ruins your home's insulation and is a permanent, difficult modification.
* **Control and Safety:** You can turn an electric heater off with a switch. You can’t easily "turn off" a giant pipe of 400°F air without the heat backing up into your outdoor box and potentially melting your turbine.
* **The "Multi-Tool" Factor:** With the PMA, you aren't just surviving; you're **thriving**. Being able to charge a phone, run a LED light, or power a laptop keeps you connected to the world. A hot pipe only does one thing: it moves air.

### 3. Estimated Costs for the PMA Setup

To reach that **1200W–1600W** threshold safely, here are the professional-grade components you'd need.

The Freedom II 1600 Watt PMG is the engine of this entire plan. It is a "Low RPM" unit, meaning it starts making usable voltage even if your thermal draft is just a steady breeze rather than a hurricane.

* **Estimated Cost:** **$350.00 – $395.00**

For the heaters, a "bank" of 12V 200W PTC Ceramic Heaters is the safest way to go. These don't have glowing wires, so they won't dry out your eyes or pose a major fire risk if a blanket falls on them.

* **Estimated Cost:** **$25.00 each** (You'd want 4 to 6 of them).

### 4. Survival Comparison Table

### The Final Verdict

Go with the **PMA**. The ability to run your full technology suite (tablet, phone, lights) while heating your kitchen is worth the slight loss in thermal efficiency. It turns your "survival cabin" into a "modern home" that just happens to be powered by a hydrogen flame.

**Would you like me to find a "12V to 5V USB Converter" so you can safely charge your phone directly from the turbine wire?**
