This is a deep engineering question that gets into the heart of **thermal management**.

To answer you directly: **Yes, it is possible** to have the PMA inside the house, but it complicates the build and reduces your peak power potential.

### 1. The Inside vs. Outside Choice

If you put the PMA inside the house:

* **The "Waste Heat" Advantage:** Any heat the PMA generates while working (about 10-20% of your power) stays inside your house. Instead of "wasting" that heat to the blizzard, it helps warm your kitchen.
* **The "Cooling" Disadvantage:** Your house is 70°F. The outside is 5°F. In the summer or during a long run, the PMA might struggle to stay cool. If it overheats, you have to throttle the hydrogen flame to prevent damaging the magnets.
* **The Noise:** PMAs are relatively quiet, but they do have a "hum" or "whir" when spinning at high speeds. Inside a quiet kitchen, that might become annoying over several hours.

### 2. The Engineering Verdict

If I were building this for a polar vortex scenario, **I would still keep the PMA outside.** **Here is why:**
In a survival situation, **Reliability** is king.

1. **Magnet Life:** By keeping the PMA in the 5°F air, you are guaranteed that the magnets stay in their "super-efficient" zone. You never have to worry about them getting too hot.
2. **Structural Simplicity:** If the PMA is inside, you have to run a **spinning metal shaft** through your wall. This is much harder to seal than a wire. It lets drafts in and is a major "vibration" path that could shake your wall.
3. **The "Wire is Easier" Rule:** It is much easier to push a 10-gauge wire through a small, caulked hole than it is to engineer a rotating mechanical seal through a house wall.

### 3. Efficiency Loss Estimate

* **Outside (5°F):** The PMA runs at its maximum theoretical efficiency. You can pull the full 1600 Watts without a second thought.
* **Inside (70°F):** You might lose **3-5% efficiency** due to increased resistance in the copper as it warms up. More importantly, you might have to limit your output to **1000 Watts** to prevent the internal temperature from climbing too high in a stagnant indoor room.

### 4. Recommended Gear for the "Outside" Choice

The Freedom II 1600 Watt PMG is the clear winner for an outdoor mount. Its aluminum "finned" housing is specifically designed to shed heat into the wind. In a 5°F environment, this thing will stay ice-cold even while pumping out massive current.

To bridge the gap through the wall, use the 10/3 SOOW Power Cord. It allows you to keep the "fire and rotation" outside while bringing the "silent heat" inside.

### Summary

Keep the **Fire** (Hydrogen Box), the **Motion** (Turbine), and the **Generation** (PMA) all in one compact unit **outside**, 5 feet from the wall.

Bring only the **Electricity** (Wire) and the **Fuel Source** (H2 Tubing) through the wall. This keeps your home quiet, safe, and draft-free.

**Would you like me to find a "Weatherproof Junction Box" so you can safely connect your 10-gauge wire to the PMA outside?**
