# Generators that Run on Hydrogen from Water Using Solar Panels and Batteries

Do NOT try this experiment, because it is dangerous!

WARNING: Do not do this experiment for it might result in serious injury or death!

The concept that I am exploring is the theoretical use of Hydrogen from water harvested using Batteries charged using Solar panels to power an Electric Generator outside of the home.

In this way I can generate 7000 watts easily and plug Electric space heaters directly into the generator and keep the house heated!
