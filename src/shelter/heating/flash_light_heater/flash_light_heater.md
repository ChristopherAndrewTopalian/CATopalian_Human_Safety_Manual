# Flash Light Heater 
Don't try this at home. Don't make this invention, because it can be very dangerous!
The heat would cause possible burns! The light would possibly blind the person if the chamber wasn't made perfectly. In other words, this is NOT something to do. Remember I am telling you to NOT make this invention.

With that warning being said: I have an idea for a 1 million Lumen flash light to be aimed inside of a chamber that has either 1 or many parabolic shapes. This chamber will likely be stainless steel.

I expect the chamber to heat up very quickly, possibly to over 1,000f.

The DANGERS:
* The Chamber has to 100% closed to prevent light from escaping, or else if any light was visible it would risk permanet eye injury from ANY ANGLE!

* HEAT: If the heat is not correctly planned for, that 1,000f metal might be a danger to anyone who isn't accounted for!

This being said, it would seem that logically this light heater and parabolic shapes might be a very efficient heating system, if it was to be engineered by professionals.

I would call this the Light Heater, or Flash Light Heater, or the Parabolic Flash Light Heater. 

Remember, do NOT try this at home and do NOT attempt to make this invention, because it is very dangerous!
