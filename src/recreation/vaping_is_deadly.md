# Vaping_is_deadly
Vaping is deadly because all vape devices are deadly!
1. Metal Inhalation from metal coil heating
2. Ceramic Dust from the use of ceramics in manufacturing

---

There is NO such thing as a safe vape device!

---

Vapes expose the human to:
* LEAD
* Cadmium
* Chromium
and many more metals that should not be in a humans lungs and blood stream and organs

---

So what should humans do instead? Never do vapes, period.

I will not tell you want to do, because everyone is different, but I will tell you what I think is a smarter long term life choice.

A glass pipe with a butane lighter for cannabis in a legal state, means no metal particulates and no metal fumes or ceramic dust inhaled. The flower is tested for any contaiminents in legal states.

That being said, edibles that we can make in legal states would be much smarter and long term than smoking at all of course.

The idea is for humans to find a safer recreation.

Vaping is NOT safe.
