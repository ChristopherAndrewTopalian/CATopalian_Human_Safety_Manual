# Cook All Food
> ## If you don't cook it, don't eat it! 

### All food, such as:
* strawberries 
* bananas  
are insect nurseries.  
The insects lay their eggs in the outdoor food.

---

For things such as bananas and strawberries they can be baked into breads.

The high heat kills the parasites and their eggs.

---

If you don't cook all food, then you will end up with worms.

# BOIL ALL FOOD FROM THE GARDEN!
We must BOIL anything that a human will eat.  
The garden food is full of parasites from the soil and from the insects.
