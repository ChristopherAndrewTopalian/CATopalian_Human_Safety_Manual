# Cheese Kills Millions
Yep, cheese. Cheese is one of the biggest killers on Earth. Why? Blockages.

Cheese is not really a food. Cheese is actually dairy that was allowed to age many months. 

Parmasean cheese for instance is 9 months old.

The biggest issues with cheese are:
1. NO FIBER - means it won't easily move through the 20ft of intestines
2. Causes blockages from the no fiber, which leads to parasite infestations from inability to flush out the system and in general the person would not be getting rid of waste efficiently because the cheese is literally blocking their intestines for months!
3. Estrogen delivery all day and all night for months as long as that cheese is in the persons intestines.
4. Casomorphin - the person is high on opiate peptides from digesting cheese. This leads them to have multiple personality disorder and when on estrogen this leads to interestiing consequences.
